            Defective airbags made by Takata have been linked to at least 21 deaths and more than 400 injuries in the U.S. As many as 55 million vehicles are affected, according to the NHTSA. 

            Let’s walk through the history of the biggest auto recall in U.S. history — one that’s still ongoing.

            <p>In 2009, an eighteen-year-old student bled to death after her 2001 Honda Accord bumped another car in the school parking lot. The airbag exploded with such force that the metal debris sliced open her carotid artery.</p>

            <p>At the time, only about 4,000 vehicles had been recalled. This was the first time Honda publicly acknowledged the issue, but failed to disclose that it knew about prior injuries caused by the malfunctioning airbags.</p>

            <p>Honda soon expanded that recall to 440,000 cars. Six months after Parham’s death, another airbag ruptured, killing 33-year-old Gurjit Rathore. Both cases were settled privately.</p>
            <p>The NHTSA opened an inquiry into Honda and Takata, but closed the probe just six months later.</p>

            <p>More than a decade later, 67 million airbags from at least 42 million vehicles in the U.S. have been recalled.</p>
